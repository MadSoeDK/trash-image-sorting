<h2>Group information</h2>
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk></strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>13</p>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the study number for each member in the group</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><em>sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s215805, s260399, s214964, s234855</p>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A requirement to the project is that you include a third-party package not covered in the course. What framework</strong>
<strong>did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the</em>
<em>package to do ... and ... in our project</em>.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used the third‑party framework timm (PyTorch Image Models),
which is a collection of many pretrained image models, as a
core component of our project. We used timm.create_model()
to load a pretrained convolutional network (in our case, a
MobileNetV3 variant "mobilenetv3_small_100"), which served
as the backbone of our image‑classification pipeline. Using
a pretrained model allowed us to leverage modern architectures
and transfer learning with minimal effort. With timm we can
quickly load a model, fine tune it on our own data and use it
to make predictions.
Without timm, we would have had to manually implement the
entire model or import less‑well‑tested model definitions. Timm
significantly reduced boilerplate code and allowed us to focus
more on the training pipeline and evaluation rather than
low‑level model engineering.</p>
<h2>Coding environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go</strong>
<strong>through to get an exact copy of your environment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a</em>
<em>complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used <code>uv</code> for managing our dependencies, which are all listed in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file. This includes both production dependencies like PyTorch, FastAPI, and Hydra, as well as development tools like pytest and ruff in a separate dev group. To set up an identical environment, a new team member would need to install <code>uv</code> first, then run <code>uv sync</code> in the project root. This reads the lock file and installs all dependencies with exact versions. We also provide a devcontainer configuration that sets up the complete development environment automatically in VS Code. Lastly, for data, we use DVC to download the datasets from a Google Cloud Platform(GCP) bucket.</p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your</strong>
<strong>code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder</em>
<em>because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our</em>
<em>experiments.</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We started with the cookiecutter MLOps template and filled out the core folders like <code>src/trashsorting</code>, <code>configs</code>, <code>tests</code>, and <code>data</code>. The main module includes <code>data.py</code> for loading our trash dataset, <code>model.py</code> for defining the model architecture, <code>train.py</code> for training, and <code>api.py</code> for the FastAPI endpoints. The root <code>model</code> contains the output from the training phase with model weights etc. We used the <code>dockerfiles</code> folder with separate dockerfiles for training and API deployment. We also created a <code>static</code> folder inside the core module for frontend files and used the <code>notebooks</code> folder for exploratory analysis and demos. We removed the <code>visualize.py</code> file since we ended up doing most visualization in notebooks instead. Overall we followed the template structure closely.</p>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,</strong>
<strong>explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These</em>
<em>concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used Ruff for both linting and formatting. We added type hints throughout our code using Python's typing module. Pre-commit hooks helped us catch issues before they get committed, things like trailing whitespace, broken YAML files, and large files. These practices matter a lot in team projects because they keep the codebase consistent and readable. Type hints especially help catch bugs early and make it easier to understand what functions expect as inputs. When multiple people are working on the same code, having automated formatting means you don't waste time arguing about style or reviewing formatting changes.</p>
<h2>Version control</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
corporate and increase the quality of your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our</em>
<em>application but also ... .</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 7 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close</strong>
<strong>to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
</em>code and even if we were then...*</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 8 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and</strong>
<strong>pull request can help improve version control.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in</em>
<em>addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We used branches and pull requests throughout the project. Each team member typically worked on their own feature branches with names like <code>mads/frontend-app</code>, <code>vhy/dvc-google-cloud-storage</code>, or <code>data-loading</code> for specific features. When a feature was ready, we'd open a pull request to merge it into main. This let other team members review the code before merging, which helped catch bugs and ensure code quality. We also had some automated checks running on PRs through GitHub Actions. The PR workflow was especially helpful when multiple people were working on different parts of the codebase simultaneously. It helped prevent merge conflicts and made sure everyone knew what changes were being made. We kept branch protection simple. Merges to main required pull requests, but we skipped mandatory reviewer approvals to move faster given the short timeframe. Stricter protections would be needed for larger or open source projects.</p>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version</strong>
<strong>control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our</em>
<em>pipeline</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 10 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,</strong>
<strong>linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free</strong>
<strong>to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing</em>
<em>and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen</em>
<em>here: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Running code and tracking experiments</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
especially the reproducibility of your experiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would</strong>
<strong>run a experiment.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Experiments were configured using Hydra
with a central params.yaml file to manage
hyperparameters and other relevant variables,
effectively replacing the need for a traditional
argparser. Additionally, we used Invoke as a
task runner to standardize preprocessing,
training, and evaluation, as well as interactions
with GCP services and Docker‑based workflows
to ensure reproducibility. </p>
<p>To train the model: <code>uv run invoke train</code>
To evaluate the model: <code>uv run invoke evaluate</code> etc.</p>
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information</strong>
<strong>is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment</em>
<em>one would have to do ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To ensure reproducibility of all experiments and
avoid loss of information during training, we
rely on PyTorch Lightning’s built‑in logging and
checkpointing mechanisms. All important metrics
such as loss, accuracy, and test performance are
logged automatically, and when enabled, Weights
&amp; Biases further logs potential hyperparameter sweeps
and configuration details.
We also use a ModelCheckpoint callback that saves
the best-performing model based on validation loss,
ensuring the exact state of the optimal model is
always preserved. Finally, PyTorch Lightning’s
self.save_hyperparameters() stores all model parameters
alongside the checkpoint, making each saved model fully
reproducible.</p>
<h3>Question 14</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&amp;B (or another experiment tracking</strong>
<strong>service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take</strong>
<strong>inspiration from <a href="figures/wandb.png">this figure</a>. Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are</strong>
<strong>important.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.</em>
<em>As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 14 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 15</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your</strong>
<strong>experiments/project? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the</em>
<em>training docker image: <code>docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64</code>. Link to docker file: <weblink></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We created two main Docker images: one for training and one for API deployment. The training image uses <code>uv</code> for dependency management and mounts volumes for data and models. You can run it with <code>docker run --rm -v ./data:/app/data -v ./models:/app/models train_1:latest</code>. We also set up <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> for easier orchestration. The API dockerfile uses a multi-stage build to keep the production image small. The builder stage installs dependencies, then the runtime stage only copies what's needed. To run the API: <code>docker run -p 8080:8080 api:latest</code>. Both dockerfiles are in the <code>dockerfiles/</code> folder. The API image was deployed to Google Cloud Run for production. Link to train dockerfile: <a href="https://github.com/MadSoeDK/trash-image-sorting/blob/main/dockerfiles/train.dockerfile">train.dockerfile</a></p>
<h3>Question 16</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you</strong>
<strong>try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling</em>
<em>run of our main code at some point that showed ...</em></p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<h3>Question 23</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you manage to write an API for your model? If yes, explain how you did it and if you did anything special. If</strong>
<strong>not, explain how you would do it.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did manage to write an API for our model. We used FastAPI to do this. We did this by ... . We also added ...</em>
<em>to the API to make it more ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We built an API using FastAPI. The main endpoint is <code>/api/predict</code>, which accepts image uploads and returns the predicted trash category with confidence scores for all six classes (cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash). We used a lifespan context manager to load the model once at startup rather than on every request, which improves performance. The API includes proper error handling for invalid images and model loading failures. We added CORS middleware to allow frontend access and created additional endpoints like <code>/api/health</code> for monitoring and <code>/api/model/info</code> for getting model details. We also used Pydantic models for request/response validation with schema examples. The API serves a static frontend at the root path, so users can interact with it through a web interface. Everything is documented with OpenAPI/Swagger available at <code>/docs</code>.</p>
<h3>Question 24</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you manage to deploy your API, either in locally or cloud? If not, describe why. If yes, describe how and</strong>
<strong>preferably how you invoke your deployed service?</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For deployment we wrapped our model into application using ... . We first tried locally serving the model, which</em>
<em>worked. Afterwards we deployed it in the cloud, using ... . To invoke the service an user would call</em>
<em><code>curl -X POST -F "file=@file.json"&lt;weburl&gt;</code></em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We deployed the API both locally and to the cloud. We started by testing locally using <code>uvicorn src.trashsorting.api:app --reload</code>, which worked well for development. For production, we deployed to Google Cloud Run, which was a good fit since it handles autoscaling and only charges for actual usage. The deployment process involved building the Docker image using our multi-stage dockerfile, pushing it to Google Artifact Registry, and then deploying it to Cloud Run. The API is live at <a href="https://trashsorting-api-fafnprv65a-ew.a.run.app/">https://trashsorting-api-fafnprv65a-ew.a.run.app/</a>. To invoke the service, you can use: <code>curl -X POST -F "file=@trash_image.jpg" https://trashsorting-api-fafnprv65a-ew.a.run.app/api/predict</code>. The API also has a web frontend at the root URL where users can upload images through their browser.</p>
<h3>Question 25</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you perform any unit testing and load testing of your API? If yes, explain how you did it and what results for</strong>
<strong>the load testing did you get. If not, explain how you would do it.</strong></p>
<p>Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>For unit testing we used ... and for load testing we used ... . The results of the load testing showed that ...</em>
<em>before the service crashed.</em></p>
